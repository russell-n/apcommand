The Change Prompt Command
=========================
.. currentmodule:: apcommand.commands.changeprompt
A module to change the prompt variable on a device. It is meant to help serial, telnet and other connections that read streams. It was created for Linux devices and has not been tested on other types (I think it works on Cygwin, anyway).
