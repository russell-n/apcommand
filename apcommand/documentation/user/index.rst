User Documentation
==================

Installing this package will create two commands (so far) -- ``atheros`` and ``broadcom``. Although they are similar, they were done at separate times and in isolation (and both abandoned when the APs were taken away) so they are not entirely the same.

The Atheros
-----------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   The `atheros` Command Interface <apcommand_command_line>
   The Atheros (Serial or Telnet) Command Line <atheros_command_line>

The Broadcom
------------

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 1

   The Broadcom Command Line Interface <broadcom_command_line>
