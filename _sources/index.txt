AP Command Documentation
========================

This is the documentation for the `apcommand <https://github.com/russellnakamura/apcommand>`_, a command-line controller that was created to enable someone using a language other than python (specifically `perl`) to have a way to control a Wireless Access Point without needing to implement the interface to the access point directly. The code itself is hosted on `github <https://github.com/russellnakamura/apcommand>`_.
